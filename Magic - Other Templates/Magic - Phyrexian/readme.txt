New user notes:
	The begin sentence symbol is \
	The end sentence symbol is .
	The Phyrexian language works phonetically, and does not translate into the Latin alphabet directly, therefore typing a word will not create that word in Phyrexian
	All characters are case insensitive
	Use _ to continue the sentence line, space bar will break the line
	The + and - symbols are designed to fit beneath the previous character to emulate the use on Magic cards, however these are buggy


There are known errors concerning use of the Phyrexian Regular font in conjunction with the Phyrexian MSE template, including but not limited to:
	+ and - symbols do not align correctly
	Numbers in mana symbols may be cut off slightly
	The end sentence symbol (.) may not connect correctly


If you find any further errors, or even better fixes for them, let Anuttymous know at magicseteditor.sourceforge.net.

		All upper case letters have been mapped also to lower case
		( and ) have been created
		G has instead been mapped to S and s as G is used to represent green mana symbol in Magic Set Editor
		v has instead been mapped to >
		x has instead been mapped to %
		^ has instead been mapped to <
		~ has instead been mapped to ^ as ~ is autoreplaced in Magic Set Editor
